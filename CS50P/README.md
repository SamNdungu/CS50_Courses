# CS50: Introduction to Programming with Python

Welcome to my repository for **CS50's Introduction to Programming with Python**! 

This project is a part of my journey through the course, which covers the fundamentals of **Python programming**. 
If you’re also taking this course or just interested in learning Python, this might be a useful resource.

- **In the beginning:** Dived into the basics of Python—getting comfortable with its syntax and structure, and understanding how to use variables effectively. We then move on to functions, which help us break down problems and write more organized code. Variables play a big role in this, allowing us to store and manipulate data.

- **Conditional statements:** Letting our programs make decisions based on different conditions. This is followed by loops, which are crucial for running code repeatedly and handling tasks like processing data.

- **Handling errors:** Python's exception handling tools help manage unexpected issues without crashing our programs. We also explore Python’s libraries, both built-in and external, which provide additional functionality and make coding more efficient.

- **Unit testing:** Introduced to ensure our code works correctly, using Python’s `unittest` framework to test our functions and logic. We also cover file input and output (I/O), allowing us to work with files for reading and writing data.

- **Regular expressions:** Come into play for pattern matching and text manipulation, which is handy when dealing with complex strings. Finally, we tackle Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), learning about classes and objects to create modular and reusable code.

*Overall*, this repository captures the essentials of the course and serves as a reference for the key concepts I’ve learned along the way.
